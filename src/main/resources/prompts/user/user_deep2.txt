{text}
Object to Analyze: {subject}

Instructions:

Strictly use object as source (even if the text uses synonyms).

Only extract DIRECT relations (e.g., for atom → nucleus → proton, return atom → nucleus, not atom → proton).

Precise relation types:

Use has_part for components.

Use verbs (e.g., revolve_around) for process.

Avoid vague terms like "related_to".

Include process relations (e.g., movement, interactions).

Skip redundant/indirect relations (e.g., unit → proton is invalid).

Example for atom:

{"source": "electron", "target": "nucleus", "relation": "revolves_around", "attribute": "", "statement": "Electrons revolve around the nucleus", "category": "process"}
