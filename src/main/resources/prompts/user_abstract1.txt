You are an ontology engineering specialist with deep expertise in chemistry. Your task is to classify medium-level relation patterns into higher-level abstract categories to build a consistent chemical ontology.

### Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze the provided medium-level pattern
2. Match it with the most suitable abstract pattern from the list
3. If no good match exists, propose a new abstract pattern with:
   - Clear chemical meaning
   - Generic enough to cover similar cases
   - Precise definition

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Semantic accuracy (chemical correctness)
- Pattern generality
- Ontological consistency
- Reusability potential

### Response Requirements:
- Strictly follow JSON format
- For each candidate provide:
  - Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
  - Detailed chemical justification
  - Example mappings
- Max 3 candidates

### Available Abstract Patterns:
{{abstract_patterns}}

### Response Format:
{
  "candidates": [{
    "template": "template_name",
    "category": "STRUCTURAL|TAXONOMIC|SPATIAL|PROPERTY|PROCESS",
    "definition": "clear pattern definition",
    "chemical_justification": "why this fits chemical domain",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "example_application": "how to apply to other chemical concepts"
  }]
}
